# Assignment-3

## Summary

The goal of this assignment was to create a password generator with four possible character options to choose from. 

One must be chosen for the password to generate and then it should be placed into a text area. 

Optionally we could add the ability to copy to the clipboard.

## How This Was Achieved

I took the example code from the Bootcampspot repository and imported Bootstrap 4 as per Assignment 2. 

We are hosting the code on a GitHub repository and on GitHub Pages.

## Challenges Faced

I originally had issues with working out if I should use one array or multiple. I went with multiple.

Next was the validation. I knew what I wanted to do but I wasn't sure how to write it. There are a few ideas I have but I wasn't sure how to execute them:

* Push a minimum of 1 character of each available character array into the main array and then subtract the number of times that the prompt had been accepted
* Declare each available character array earlier then divide the number of characters chosen by the password types accepted.

In the end I wasn't able to achieve it based on what I had learned so far. I did the bonus question in the hope that it would help my final mark and I knew I would improve from here in future.

## Final Thoughts

I found this to be quite a step up from previous assignments overall. I believe I have a bit of burn out from working in the same industry and need to find a way to refocus before the next assignment.
